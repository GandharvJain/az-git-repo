            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>"Titanic" is a classic 1997 film directed by James Cameron. It's my favorite movie series because of its epic romance and the tragic story of the ill-fated RMS Titanic, making it one of the most iconic films in cinematic history.</p>

            <p>Two of my favorite characters from the movie are Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (played by Kate Winslet). Their performances and chemistry on screen are truly remarkable, making us emotionally invested in their love story.</p>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>The film is set against the backdrop of the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic, a luxurious ocean liner. The story follows the passionate but doomed romance between Jack, a penniless artist, and Rose, an upper-class young woman. As the ship collides with an iceberg, their love is tested in the face of impending disaster. "Titanic" is a timeless tale of love, tragedy, and the human spirit.</p>
